# data-structures-2

These are two projects I did to school for a subject called Algorithms and data structures. Idea of the projects is evidence of real estates and lands, filtering of these objects, 
adding, editing and deleting them, while being time and memory efficient.

First project aims on efficiency with RAM, applying usage of K-D Tree. K-D Tree stands for K dimensional tree, K being the dimension of the tree, or simply said, how many keys 
each of the nodes have. Keys are then compared by the key based on the level of actual node being compared. This project has been evaluated with 13/13 points available.

Second project aims on storage of large amounts of data, for example in databases, so it aims on disk efficiency, applying usage od Extensible Hashing. Data are stored in the 
structure with keys, which are then translated to hash and stored in corresponding block in memory. If the blocks are full, they are stored in a congesting file. This project
has also been evaluated with 13/13 points available.
