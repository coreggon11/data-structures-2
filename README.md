# data-structures-2

These are two projects I did to school for a subject called Algorithms and data structures.  For UI I have used my own, already existing components library with Graphics2D, and it is just a simple UI because that was not the main point of the projects. The idea of the projects is evidence of real estate and lands, filtering of these objects, adding, editing, and deleting them, while being time and memory efficient. 

The first project aims at the efficiency with RAM, applying the usage of the K-D Tree. K-D Tree stands for K dimensional tree, K being the dimension of the tree, or simply said, how many keys each of the nodes have. Nodes are then compared by the key based on the level of the actual node being compared. This project has been evaluated with 13/13 points available. 

The second project aims at the storage of large amounts of data, for example in databases, so it aims at disk efficiency, applying the usage of Extensible Hashing. Data is stored in the structure with keys, which are then translated to hash and stored in the corresponding blocks in memory. If the blocks are full, they are stored in a congesting file. This project has also been evaluated with 13/13 points available.
